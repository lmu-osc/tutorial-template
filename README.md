# Tutorial Template

This repository is a starter template for Quarto-based OSC tutorials. It provides a simple, accessible structure you can copy and adapt to publish a small course or tutorial website.

## Primary Documentation

This README only serves as a brief documentation page. Details of the repo and how to adapt it for other tutorials can be found at our publicly-available manual in the [Authoring Tutorials for the OSC](https://lmu-osc.github.io/manual/authoring-tutorials/) section.

## Quick overview

- **Purpose:** A lightweight Quarto site template pre-configured for OSC (Open Science Center) tutorials.
- **Who it's for:** educators and researchers who want an easy-to-edit website using Quarto; no deep web development experience required.


### Quick Start!

Assuming you are a member of the lmu-osc GitHub Organization, you will likely have the rights to create new repos in our org. In particular, you can create new repos from an existing template i.e. using the `tutorial-template` repo. Choose this option when creating your new repo, and follow these instructions:

```bash
quarto use template lmu-osc/tutorial-template
# if you created the project into a subfolder, then run: 
# cd YOUR-FOLDER
mv CITATION-template.cff CITATION.cff
quarto preview
```

Optional: get your website deployed right away (only works for public repos):

```bash
quarto publish gh-pages
```

This may take several minutes to run, but you can check the Actions tab within the repo to see progress. If you run into problems, however, feel free to contact an OSC staff member. Read our documentation on [Activating GitHub Pages](https://lmu-osc.github.io/manual/authoring-tutorials/finalization-and-publishing.html#activate-github-pages-one-time-setup).


## Structure Overview

Top-level files and directories you'll commonly interact with:

- `_quarto.yml` — Site configuration (title, navigation, output settings, theme). Update this to change the site title, navigation order, or basic site settings. We already have a multitude of presets in place here, but feel free to look at Quarto's documentation for further options.
- `index.qmd` — The site homepage content i.e. the landing page when someone opens the link to the tutorial. This should generally be an overview of the tutorial + necessary software information.
- `about.qmd` — An example about page for your tutorial. It's main role is to contain License, Citation, and Contributor information.
- `CITATION.cff` — Citation metadata for your project (authors, affiliations, ORCID, etc.). See the official  [CITATION.cff](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) documentation or sent an OSC member a message if it's unclear how to fill this in.
- `LICENSE.md` and `LICENSE-CODE.md` — License text for content and code respectively. We use CC-BY-SA 4.0 and CC0 1.0 Universal for authored content and code, respectively.
- `lmu-osc-custom.scss` — Site-specific SCSS tweaks; add branding or small visual changes here.
- `styles.css` — Additional CSS classes for page content (e.g., `.center`, `.img-border`, `.output-overflow`). Edit this file for content-level styling.
- `matomo-analytics.html` — Analytics snippet (managed by OSC staff; do not edit unless instructed).
- `assets/` — Images, downloads, and other static files used by the site.
- `topic-one/`, `topic-two/`, ... — Example topic folders containing `.qmd` pages for tutorial sections. Replace or rename these to match your content.
- `_site/` — Generated site files (output). You normally do not edit this folder directly — it's produced when you build the site.
- `.filenameignore` — Patterns ignored by the automated filename check workflow. Add paths here if the workflow flags files that should be skipped.
- `.gitignore` — Files and directories Git should ignore (e.g., history files, temporary R output). Edit if your project generates new temporary files.

If you want to change what appears in the site's navigation, edit the `sidebar:` and `navbar:` sections in `_quarto.yml`.



## Running Actions (for non-technical contributors)

This template has several automations in place to help ensure consistency across our repositories, namely a citation file checker, a filename checker, an automation for publishing the site, and a code style formatter. You can see details at `.github/workflows/README.md` if interested, but it's not required to know these details by any means.

- If you need to run a repository workflow (for example to re-render the site), open this repository on GitHub and click the **Actions** tab.
- Select the workflow you want (examples: "Render Quarto Site", "Check CITATION.cff", "Filename Checks", "Tidyverse Style Formatting").
- Click **Run workflow**, and then select the branch you want to test a workflow on from the "Branch:" dropdown. Then click **Run workflow** again to start it.
- After the workflow starts, you can monitor progress on the same page and inspect step logs if something fails. If you are unsure what to do after a failure, open a GitHub issue and paste the error or screenshot.
- If you do not see the **Run workflow** button, you can still make changes by editing files and pushing them to GitHub; the workflows that trigger on `push` will run automatically.

## Conventions and tips

- File names: lowercase and kebab-case (e.g. `my-topic/my-page.qmd`).
- Content: use plain text and simple Markdown/Quarto; avoid embedding complex web widgets unless needed.
- Collaboration: edit content on GitHub using branches and pull requests so teammates can review changes.
